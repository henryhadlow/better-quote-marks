# A keyboard layout (macOS, British) with better typographer’s quotes

I like to use ‘smart’ quotes (aka typographer’s quotes) but I find default macOS keyboard layout counter-intuitive.

Quote marks come in pairs of left and right. They’re typed using the `[` and `]` keys.

So I put the left quote marks on the left bracket `[`, and the right quote marks on the right bracket `]`.

## How it works

- To type single quotes, use `alt` + `[` and `]`.
- To type double quotes, use `shift` + `alt` + `[` and `]`.

## How to install

- Copy `British keyboard layout with custom quote marks.bundle` to:
    - `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` to install it for just your user account
    - `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` to install it for all accounts on your computer
- Open _System Preferences_ ▶ _Keyboard_ ▶ _Input sources_
- Add _British with custom quote marks_
- Remove _British_ if you like (sometimes the OS switches back to it randomly)

## How I made this

I made a custom keyboard layout and exported the installer using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).

## How to access typographer’s quotes on a default macOS keyboard layout

If you don’t want to install this, you can still type typographer’s quotes on a default macOS keyboard layout. I just think my shortcuts are nicer.

- To type an left single quote, use `alt` + `]`
- To type a right single quote, use `alt` + `shift` + `]`
- To type an left double quote, use `alt` + `[`
- To type a right double quote, use `alt` + `shift` + `[`
