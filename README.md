# A keyboard layout (macOS, British) with better typographer’s quotes

I like to use ‘smart’ quotes (aka typographer’s quotes) but I find default macOS keyboard layout counter-intuitive.

Quote marks come in pairs of left and right. They’re typed using the `[` and `]` keys.

So I put the left quote marks on the left bracket `[`, and the right quote marks on the right bracket `]`.

To type single quotes, use `alt` + `[` and `]`.

To type double quotes, use `shift` + `alt` + `[` and `]`.

## How to install

Copy `British keyboard layout with custom quote marks.bundle` to:

- `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` to install it for just your user account
- `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` to install it for all accounts on your computer

## How I made this

I made a custom keyboard layout and exported the installer using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).
